# Reaxpress Backend

Here is where you'll find the main Express server that serves your frontend application, and where you can also store any [services](#services) or whatever else you want.

## Services

Ideally you can put whatever you think is a service in here. However, I recommend following a microservice approach, each individual service being a separate express server. You can do research on microservices of course, but I'd recommend [this in-depth article](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-1-7e28e25bfa8b) by Christian Ramirez for a good headspace. In fact for brevity, I'll quote him:

> **The benefits of microservices**
>
> - The application starts faster, which makes developers more productive, and speeds up deployments.
> - Each service can be deployed independently of other services — easier to deploy new versions of services frequently
> - Easier to scale development and can also have performance advantages.
> - Eliminates any long-term commitment to a technology stack. When developing a new service you can pick a new technology stack.
> - Microservices are typically better organized, since each microservice has a very specific job, and is not concerned with the jobs of other components.
> - Decoupled services are also easier to recompose and reconfigure to serve the purposes of different apps (for example, serving both the web clients and public API).
>
> **The drawbacks of microservices**
>
> - Developers must deal with the additional complexity of creating a distributed system.
> - Deployment complexity. In production, there is also the operational complexity of deploying and managing a system comprised of many different service types.
> - As you’re building a new microservice architecture, you’re likely to discover lots of cross-cutting concerns that you did not anticipate at design time.

I'll be making a microservice-specific recipe at some point, so when that's up you may find those more interesting.
